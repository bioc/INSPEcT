Description: INSPEcT (INference of Synthesis, Processing and
    dEgradation rates in Time-Course experiments) analyses 4sU-seq
    and RNA-seq time-course data in order to evaluate synthesis,
    processing and degradation rates and asses via modeling the
    rates that determines changes in mature mRNA levels.
