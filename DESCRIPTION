Description: INSPEcT (INference of Synthesis, Processing and
        dEgradation rates in Time-Course experiments) analyses 4sU-seq
        and RNA-seq time-course data in order to evaluate synthesis,
        processing and degradation rates and asses via modeling the
        rates that determines changes in mature mRNA levels.
