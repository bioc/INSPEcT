\title{MA-plot from base means and log fold changes}
\usage{
\S4method{plotMA}{INSPEcT_diffsteady}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of calss INSPEcT_diffsteady}

\item{...}{Additional parameters, see Details section}
}
\description{
Visualize the comparison between the rates calculated from two different INSPEcT objects
profiled in steady-state conditions.
}
\details{
Possible arguments to "plotMA":
\itemize{
\item "rate" - A character, which represent the rate to be visualized, either "synthesis", "processing" or "degradation". By default, "synthesis" is chosen.
\item "alpha" - A numeric, The confidence interval for significance (FDR), by default 0.1
\item "xlim" - A numeric vector of length 2, limits of x-axis, by default the range of the data.
\item "xlab" - A character, the label of x-axis, by default "log2 geometric mean"
\item "ylim" - A numeric vector of length 2, limits of y-axis, by default the range of the data.
\item "ylab" - A character, the label of y-axis, by default "log2 fold change"
\item "main" - A character, the title of the plot, by default the name of the visualized rate.
}

data('simRates', package='INSPEcT')
data('simData3rep_4su', package='INSPEcT')
## generate a new data set with 3 replicate to make the comparison
newTpts <- c(0, 16)
simData3rep_4su_2 <- makeSimDataset(simRates, newTpts, 3, seed=2)
diffrates <- compareSteady(simData3rep_4su, simData3rep_4su_2)
