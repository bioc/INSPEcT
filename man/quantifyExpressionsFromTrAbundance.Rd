\usage{
quantifyExpressionsFromTrAbundance(trAbundaces, experimentalDesign,
  varSamplingCondition = NULL, simulatedData = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trAbundaces}{A a list with elements "exonsAbundances" and "intronsAbundances".}

\item{experimentalDesign}{A numerical which reports the desing of the experiment in terms of time points and replicates. The time points must be ordered according
to the columns of the count matrices submitted for the analysis; these labels define conditions and replicates.}

\item{varSamplingCondition}{A character reporting which experimental condition should be used to sample the variance if DESeq2 = FALSE.}

\item{simulatedData}{A boolean which is TRUE if the data under analysis are simulated.}
}
\value{
A list containing RPKMs and associated variances for exons and introns.
}
