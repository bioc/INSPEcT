}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class INSPEcT_model, usually the output of \code{\link{makeSimModel}}}

\item{tpts}{A numeric vector of time points where rates and concentrations have to be evaluated}

\item{nRep}{Number of replicates to simulate}

\item{No4sU}{A logical which, if true, makes the output of the method suitable for an analysis wothout 4sU}

\item{seed}{A numeric to obtain reproducible results}
}
\value{
An object of the class ExpressionSet containing rates and concentrations
}
\description{
Generate synthetic rates and concentrations

This method generates rates and concentrations where noise is added according to the desired number of 
replicates that the user set as an arguments from the INSPEcT_model object that has been created by the 
method of the class INSPEcT \code{\link{makeSimModel}}. Rates and concentrations can be generated at the 
time-points of interest. This method generates an INSPEcT object that can be modeled and the performance of
the modeling can be tested directly aginst the INSPEcT_model object created by \code{\link{makeSimModel}}.
